This project, titled IBM HR Analytics: Understanding Employee Turnover, looks at why employees leave a company and what factors might help keep them. Losing employees can be expensive and disruptive for any business, so the goal of this project is to figure out what’s driving people to quit and to find ways to keep them longer.

🏆 Project Goals:
Understand the Data – Look at employee data to spot patterns and trends.
Clean and Prepare the Data – Organize the information so it’s ready for analysis.
Build Prediction Models – Use machine learning to predict which employees might leave.
Provide Insights – Identify the key reasons people leave and suggest ways to improve retention.
